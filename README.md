## Abstract
Maui Island experienced a devastating wildfire in August 2023. Given the continued displacement in 2025 and growing threats from climate-related hazards, community relocation has become a persistent challenge. This study proposes a GIS-based framework for identifying suitable community relocation under multiple planning priorities, followed by comparisons with Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and zoning data to detect urban expansion conflicts and opportunities for infill development. We first assess the population and land uses exposed to hazard risks, including sea level rise (SLR), flooding, and wildfire. Suitability criteria are organized into six dimensions: topography, exposure to hazard risks, ecologically sensitive areas, proximity to infrastructure and critical facilities, proximity to community services, and place and economic ties. We present multi-scenario suitability analysis results, including: (1) equal weighting of all criteria, and prioritizations focused on (2) hazard safety, (3) economic vitality, and (4) community cohesion. We also include (5) averaged results across the three prioritized scenarios, accompanied by a standard deviation map. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted for the prioritized scenarios to reduce uncertainty in weight selection. High-suitability, high-stability areas are then compared with LULC and zoning classifications. The analysis supports residential densification and urban expansion within or near existing urban areas, particularly around the Kahului–Wailuku and Kīhei–Wailea regions. Relocation planning in Lāhainā requires a balance between hazard safety and the preservation of heritage and economic vitality. The research framework can be replicated for other suitability analyses or decision-making processes guided by different policy priorities and grounded in land management realities.
